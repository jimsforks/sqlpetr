This project contains functions to accompany the 
[R, Databases and Docker](https://smithjd.github.io/sql-pet/) book.

## How to contribute
If you'd like to contribute to this project, start by searching through the [issues](https://github.com/smithjd/sqlpetr/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/smithjd/sqlpetr/pulls) to see whether someone else has already raised a similar idea or question.

If you don't see your idea listed, and you think it fits into the goals of this project, do one of the following:

* If your contribution is minor, such as a typo fix, open a pull request.
* If your contribution is major, such as a new learning module or a significant restructuring of current code and training material, start by opening an issue first. That way, before you do any work, other people can weigh in on the discussion to make sure that your goals are aligned with the direction of the project.

We provide more guidelines for coding style and developer's workflow in the [Contributing](https://github.com/smithjd/sqlpetr/blob/master/Contributing.md) document. The [SQL Pet Tutorial](https://github.com/smithjd/sql-pet/) [project wiki](https://github.com/smithjd/sql-pet/wiki) is also a good source of information for developers.
