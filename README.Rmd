## Introduction
`sqlpetr` is the companion R package for the database tutorial eBook at <https://github.com/smithjd/sql-pet>. It has two classes of functions:

1. Functions to install the dependencies needed to build the book and perform the operations covered in the tutorial, and
2. Utilities for dealing with Docker and the PostgreSQL Docker image we use.

`sqlpetr` has a `pkgdown` site at <https://smithjd.github.io/sqlpetr/>.

## Prerequisites
You will need the following software:

1. R 3.5.1 or later:
    * For Windows, go to <https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/windows/base/>.
    * For MacOS, go to <https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/macosx/>.
2. R source package development tools:
    * For Windows, go to <https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/windows/Rtools/> and install `Rtools35.exe`.
    * For MacOS, go to <https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/macosx/tools/> and install the packages for your MacOS version.
3. Git:
    * For Windows, use Git for Windows (https://git-scm.com/download/win).
    * For MacOS, see <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git> for the options.
4. RStudio Preview 1.2.1163 or later (<https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/>).
5. Docker:
    * For Windows 10 Pro, use Docker for Windows (<https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/>).
    * For other versions of Windows, use Docker Toolbox (<https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/overview/>).
    * For MacOS El Capitan 10.11 or newer macOS release running on a 2010 or newer Mac, with Intelâ€™s hardware support for MMU virtualization, use Docker for Mac (<https://docs.docker.com/v17.12/docker-for-mac/install/>).
    * For other versions of MacOS, use Docker Toolbox (<https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/overview/>).

See below for the details if you're a Linux desktop user.

## Installing this package for users of <https://smithjd.github.io/sql-pet>
If you are working through the code in the book, you will need to install this package first. Note that these instructions assume Windows or MacOS. For Linux, you will need to install some Linux packages and edit a configuration file. See below for the details on Ubuntu "Bionic Beaver", Debian "stretch" or Arch Linux.

1. Make sure you have a writeable personal library.
2. Update all your packages with `update.packages()`.
3. Install `devtools` if you haven't already. 
3. In an R console, type

    ```
    devtools::install_github("smithjd/sqlpetr", force = TRUE, build_vignettes = TRUE)
    ```

## Developer workflow
If you're working as a developer of this package or the book, you'll need to install more dependencies. To do that:

1. Clone this repository and open the project file `sqlpetr.Rproj` in RStudio.
2. Open the file `install_me.R` and `source` it. This will install all the dependencies and rebuild the `pkgdown` site for the package.

    On Windows, you may get a dialog box asking you if you want to install source packages. If you do, press the `Yes` button.

For more details on R package development, see [R Packages](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/).

## Pkgdown
This package uses `pkgdown` to build a package documentation site on GitHub Pages. The site is hosted at <https://smithjd.github.io/sqlpetr>. Once you've added a function, go to the RStudio Addins dropdown and select "Build pkgdown". This will render the site and open it in your browser. The `install_me.R` script rebuilds the site after installing.

For more detail on `pkgdown`, see <https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/>.

## Installing on Ubuntu "Bionic Beaver"

### Ubuntu packages you need to install
R packages are usually built from source on Linux. Before you can build this package and its dependencies from source, you will need to install the following Ubuntu packages with `sudo apt-get install`:

```
sudo apt-get install \
  libssl-dev \
  libcurl4-openssl-dev \
  libmagick++-dev \
  libpoppler-cpp-dev \
  libv8-3.14-dev \
  libpq-dev
```

### Fixing the ImageMagick policy file
A recent security update to the library we use to write images to PDF files has caused errors trying to write PDFs. You will see the error

```
<Magick::ErrorPolicy in magick_image_write(image, format, quality, depth, density, comment): Magick: not authorized `PDF:/tmp/RtmpMHXxNk/magick-12720uFi-fA7hwBIB' @ error/constitute.c/WriteImage/1037>
Error in magick_image_write(image, format, quality, depth, density, comment) : 
  Magick: not authorized `PDF:/tmp/RtmpMHXxNk/magick-12720uFi-fA7hwBIB' @ error/constitute.c/WriteImage/1037
```
  
To fix this, you need to become `root` and edit the file `/etc/ImageMagick-6/policy.xml`. Find the line

    <policy domain="coder" rights="none" pattern="PDF" />

and change `none` to `all`.
