## Introduction
`sqlpetr` is the companion R package for the database tutorial eBook at <https://github.com/smithjd/sql-pet>. It has two classes of functions:

1. Functions to install the dependencies needed to build the book and perform the operations covered in the tutorial, and
2. Utilities for dealing with Docker and the PostgreSQL Docker image we use.

`sqlpetr` has a `pkgdown` site at <https://smithjd.github.io/sqlpetr/>.

## Prerequisites
You will need the following software:

1. R 3.4.0 or later:
    * For Windows, go to <https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/windows/base/>.
    * For MacOS, go to <https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/macosx/>.
2. RStudio Preview 1.2.1330 or later (<https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/>).
3. Docker:
    * For Windows 10 Pro, use Docker for Windows (<https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/>).
    * For other versions of Windows, use Docker Toolbox (<https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/overview/>).
    * For MacOS El Capitan 10.11 or newer macOS release running on a 2010 or newer Mac, with Intelâ€™s hardware support for MMU virtualization, use Docker for Mac (<https://docs.docker.com/v17.12/docker-for-mac/install/>).
    * For other versions of MacOS, use Docker Toolbox (<https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/overview/>).

See below for the details if you're a Linux desktop user.

## Installing this package for users of <https://smithjd.github.io/sql-pet>
If you are working through the code in the book, you will need to install this package first. Note that these instructions assume Windows or MacOS. For Linux, you will need to install some Linux packages. See below for the details on Ubuntu, Fedora or Arch Linux.

1. Make sure you have a writeable personal library.
2. Update all your packages with `update.packages()`.
3. Install `remotes` if you haven't already. 
4. In an R console, type

    ```
    remotes::install_github("smithjd/sqlpetr", force = TRUE, build = FALSE, quiet = TRUE)
    ```

## Linux desktop
We support Ubuntu Linux 18.04 LTS ("Bionic Beaver") or later, Fedora 28 or later and Arch Linux. You will need to install RStudio yourself, but we provide scripts to install all the other Linux dependencies including R and Docker.

1. Install Linux - any desktop should work.
2. Browse to <https://github.com/smithjd/sqlpetr/tree/master/inst/linux>. You will find install scripts for Ubuntu, Fedora and Arch. Download the one for your distro, make it executable and run it. The script will install R and the Linux dependencies for `sqlpetr`, install Docker, add you to the `docker` group and enable/start the Docker service.
3. Now do

    ```
    remotes::install_github("smithjd/sqlpetr", force = TRUE, build = FALSE, quiet = TRUE)
    ```
    
    to install `sqlpetr`.
    
Note that you will need to log out back to the display manager prompt and log back in for Docker commands to work without `sudo`.
