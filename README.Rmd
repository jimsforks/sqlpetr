## Introduction
`sqlpetr` is the companion R package for the database tutorial eBook at <https://github.com/smithjd/sql-pet>. It has two classes of functions:

1. Functions to install the dependencies needed to build the book and perform the operations covered in the tutorial, and
2. Utilities for dealing with Docker and the PostgreSQL Docker image we use.

`sqlpetr` has a `pkgdown` site at <https://smithjd.github.io/sqlpetr/>.

## Installing for users of <https://smithjd.github.io/sql-pet>
If you are working through the code in the book, you will need to install this package first.

1. Install `devtools` if you haven't already; you'll need it to install this package. 
2. In an R console, type 
`devtools::install_github("smithjd/sqlpetr", force = TRUE, build_vignettes = TRUE)`.

## Developer workflow
If you're working as a developer of this package or the book, you'll need to install more dependencies. To do that:

1. Clone this repository and open the project file `sqlpetr.Rproj` in RStudio.
2. Open the file `install_me.R` and `source` it. This will install all the dependencies and rebuild the `pkgdown` site for the package.

For more details on R package development, see [R Packages](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/).

## Pkgdown
This package uses `pkgdown` to build a package documentation site on GitHub Pages. The site is hosted at <https://smithjd.github.io/sqlpetr>. Once you've added a function, go to the RStudio Addins dropdown and select "Build pkgdown". This will render the site and open it in your browser. The `install_me.R` script rebuilds the site after installing.

For more detail on `pkgdown`, see <https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/>.
